#### Academic Projects in my private repositories
1. **Tutoring Management System (FYP)**
    - This system is done by using Laravel framework. It includes 2 role, student and private tutor. This project aims to automate the tuition workflow to increase efficiency. Also, digitalize the hardcopy information so that the digitalized data can be used as a backup for the stakeholder.
2. **Student Job Assistant (Mobile)**
    - This mobile application is done by using Flutter. This application is to help university students to have second income while studying. This will be such a system where the users can post anything for help and the job seekers can get the order to accomplish the task.
